#SEEDLING BASAL DIAMETER TO BIOMASS (g C)
#using the allometric equations in Cole, T. G., & Ewel, J. J. (1995). Allometric equations for four valuable tropical tree species. Ecology, 229, 351â€“360. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2006.04.017
#because they include equations specifically for individuals that are too small to have a dbh.
#using Cordia alliodora for all PFTs (sample for equations included height ranges at small as 10 cm tall.)
